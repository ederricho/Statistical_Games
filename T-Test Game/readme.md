# <u>The T-Test Game<u>

We are gamifying the following hypothesis test given two samples that come from the same population:

$$H_0: \bar{x}_1 = \bar{x}_2, H_a: \bar{x}_1 \neq \bar{x}_2$$

Basic Concept:

1. At the start of the game, a normally distributed population is created.

2. Two random samples of size n are drawn.

3. Using the means, the difference of the means, histograms and boxplots, decide whether the difference in means is statistically significant.

The idea behind this game is to observe visually the likelihood of a stastistically significant difference in means between two samples.

Statistical Intuition!
